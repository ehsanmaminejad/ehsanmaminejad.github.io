Hi dear vistors! My name is Ehsan Maminejad, and welcome to my website! 

I am trying to be a problem solver in a  [build things](https://github.com/ehsanmaminejad).

I started this site to tell the story of my tech journey. I believe in
**technology that is open, enabling, and life-giving**. I aspire to usher that
potential&mdash;even for just a tiny bit. But, there is still a long way to go,
and this site records my progress. 

Here, you'll find some of my **thoughts, works, and notes** on software
development, machine learning, and research. I hope you'll spend a nice time
here, so go grab yourself a coffee and feel free to look around!
